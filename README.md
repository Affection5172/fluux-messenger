# Fluux Messenger

A fast, modern, cross-platform XMPP client for communities and organizations.

## Requirements

It is packaged to run on Windows, MacOS and Linux, and can run as a Web application.

> **Note:** Development has primarily been tested on macOS with ejabberd. Extensive testing is still needed for:
> - Web mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
> - Linux and Windows desktop builds
> - Other XMPP servers (Prosody, Openfire, Tigase, etc.) for interoperability
