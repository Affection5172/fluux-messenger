/**
 * Roster and presence type definitions.
 *
 * ## XMPP Presence Model
 *
 * In XMPP, presence works as follows:
 *
 * 1. **Resources**: A user can connect from multiple devices (resources) simultaneously.
 *    Each resource (e.g., "mobile", "desktop", "web") has its own presence state.
 *
 * 2. **Available vs Unavailable**: Presence stanzas have a `type` attribute:
 *    - No type or `type` omitted = "available" (user is online on this resource)
 *    - `type="unavailable"` = user disconnected from this resource
 *
 * 3. **Show element**: For AVAILABLE presence, the optional `<show>` element indicates
 *    sub-states of being online (away, dnd, etc.). Absence of `<show>` means plain "online".
 *
 * 4. **Offline determination**: A contact is considered OFFLINE only when they have
 *    **zero active resources**. As long as at least one resource is connected,
 *    they are online (with their "best" presence aggregated from all resources).
 *
 * ```
 * Presence Stanza Examples:
 *
 * <!-- Available, plain online (no show element) -->
 * <presence from="alice@example.com/mobile"/>
 *
 * <!-- Available, away -->
 * <presence from="alice@example.com/desktop">
 *   <show>away</show>
 *   <status>In a meeting</status>
 * </presence>
 *
 * <!-- Unavailable (going offline on this resource) -->
 * <presence from="alice@example.com/mobile" type="unavailable"/>
 * ```

/**
 * Simplified presence status for UI display.
 *
 * This is the aggregated status shown in the UI, computed from all of a
 * contact's connected resources. The "best" (most available) presence wins.
 *
 * - `online` - At least one resource is available (no show, or show='chat')
 * - `away` - Best resource is away or extended away (show='away' or 'xa')
 * - `dnd` - Best resource is do-not-disturb (show='dnd')
 * - `offline` - No connected resources (all resources sent type="unavailable")

/**
 * XMPP presence show values (protocol-level).
 *
 * The `<show>` element only appears in AVAILABLE presence stanzas to indicate
 * sub-states of being online. It is NOT used to indicate offline status.
 *
 * Values:
 * - `chat` - Free for chat (eager to communicate) → maps to 'online'
 * - `away` - Temporarily away → maps to 'away'
 * - `xa` - Extended away (gone for longer period) → maps to 'away'
 * - `dnd` - Do not disturb → maps to 'dnd'
 *
 * When the `<show>` element is absent (null), the user is plain "available/online".
 *
 * **Important**: Offline is NOT a show value. Offline is determined by:
 * - Receiving `type="unavailable"` on a presence stanza, OR
 * - Having zero connected resources for a contact
